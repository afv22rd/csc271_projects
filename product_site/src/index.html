            This is a website for my family's car dealership with features designed 
            to expand our customer base. For example, the site could allow users to 
            schedule visits, rent cars, buy and sell vehicles, view our current 
            inventory, and offer a <em>Carvana</em> style service.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this model, users can submit their vehicles for an offer, and/or buy a 
            vehicle on the site, and we handle all the paperwork, delivering the 
            purchased vehicle right to their doorstep, making everything virtual. 
        <br>
            This concept would be innovative in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>, 
            as there is currently no such service available.
